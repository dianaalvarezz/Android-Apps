# üèÅ Chessboard App

## Overview

The **Chessboard App** is a visually engaging Android application that replicates a chessboard layout. It dynamically adjusts to both portrait and landscape orientations, providing a seamless user experience. The app alternates the board's colors between traditional black-and-white and red-and-white schemes, depending on the device's orientation.

   - An 8x8 grid is dynamically created using `GridLayout`.
   - Each square is styled with alternating colors and optional chess piece labels.

2. **Orientation Handling**:
   - The app listens for device orientation changes using `onConfigurationChanged`.
   - Color schemes are updated to match the current orientation.

3. **Responsive Sizing**:
   - Calculates square dimensions to fit the screen size.
   - Adapts for navigation bar height in landscape mode.
