# Android Apps Collection ðŸ“±

## Overview
This repository is a collection of simple Android apps I've created as part of my learning journey in Android development. Each app demonstrates a fundamental concept or functionality, progressing in complexity as I continue to expand my skills.

## Apps Included
The apps range from basic to more complex as I build on new skills. Each one is designed to explore different aspects of Android programming and user interface design.

- **Beginner Apps**: These focus on foundational elements, such as layout design, basic interactions, and input validation.
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each subsequent app introduces new challenges and techniques, gradually incorporating more advanced features as I learn.

## Structure
Each app in this repository has its own folder, containing:
- **Source Code**: The main code files for the app.
- **README**: A description of the app's purpose, functionality, and features.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Android-Apps.git
